# Being a New Manager

## How to identify the shift?

How to tell if you’re at a managerial position? If you need signs to figure out that you’ve made the shift there already, here are some to name a few:

* An excess of information
* Your inbox is full
* Your calendar is booked more than ever
* Too many tasks
* You are busy Reading and Communicating
* You’re constantly being requested to be of assistance
* Feeling like there’s never enough time

## New Manager challenges

* The Execution Bridge
* Motivating Your Team
* Delegation

### The Execution Bridge
Your manager is managing a team of managers and possibly some ad-hoc functions, and it is mostly safe to say that these employees are there for a good reason, because they are good at their job, responsible, open minded and eager to succeed and bring value to the company. Being the direct manager or team leader to direct reports of engineers is simply another story. It is probably one of the most challenging and complicated tasks in the hierarchy of roles for a given company, especially if you’re new at managing. The difficulty lies in the fact that you are responsible for employees who are the critical execution pipeline, and if anything fails there the impact on the company is directly visible, and the company will simply under-deliver.

### Motivating Your Team

### Delegation
You are now facing a lot of tasks that needs to be completed yet the time at your hand is the same, or worse, has shrunk due to your busy schedule as a manager.

## New Manager opportunities
* Direct impact on products
* Networking

## New Manager actions
* Planning, Planning, Planning.
* Planning is important to scale as team grows and be prepared.
* Plan the next week in advance
* Team bonding is important, but not too excessive (bi-weekly or longer periods for team lunch)
